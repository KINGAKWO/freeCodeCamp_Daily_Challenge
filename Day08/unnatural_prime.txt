My Thought Process
At first, I thought: "Negative primes? That’s just primes with a minus sign."
And that’s exactly the trick — check primality on the absolute value of the number, then decide if it’s valid.


Python Concepts in Action
- abs() → Handle negative numbers without extra logic.
- Loop to √n → Efficient primality check.
- Conditionals → Filter out 0, 1, and -1 early.
- Boolean Return → True if prime (positive or negative), False otherwise.

Day 08: Unnatural Prime — When Primes Go Negative ⚡
Today’s #freeCodeCamp challenge was a twist on a classic:
Determine if a number is a prime or a negative prime.

A prime is a positive integer > 1 divisible only by 1 and itself.
A negative prime is simply the negative version of a prime.
(And no, 0 and 1 don’t make the cut.)
