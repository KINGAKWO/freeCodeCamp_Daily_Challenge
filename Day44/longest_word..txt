Day 44 of my freeCodeCamp Daily Python Challenge – Longest Word

Today’s challenge was about digging into strings and pulling out the longest word in a sentence. 📝

The twist?

Ignore punctuation like periods.

If there’s a tie, return the first longest word.

Instead of manually splitting and trimming, I leaned on Python’s re (regex) module to extract clean words, then used max() with key=len to find the winner. Simple, powerful, and very Pythonic.

💡 Lesson reinforced: sometimes the best solution isn’t more loops or conditions — it’s knowing the right tool (re.findall) and combining it with built-in functions.

Longest Word
Given a sentence, return the longest word in the sentence.

Ignore periods (.) when determining word length.
If multiple words are ties for the longest, return the first one that occurs.

Tests
Passed:1. get_longest_word("coding is fun") should return "coding".
Passed:2. get_longest_word("Coding challenges are fun and educational.") should return "educational".
Passed:3. get_longest_word("This sentence has multiple long words.") should return "sentence".
